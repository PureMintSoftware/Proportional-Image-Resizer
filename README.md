Proportional Image Resizer  
by Pure Mint Software  
--------------------------

Resizes a folder of images to a new user determined size, whilst keeping the proportions of the original images.   
It outputs the resized images to a new "Resized" folder inside the original image folder.  

Example 
-------

You have a folder called "Cat Memes", and the images are a mix of portrait, landscape, square, and every proportion in between.  
You want to resize them (whether up or down) so that their longest sides all become 1000 pixels, whilst maintaining their original proportionality.  
  
Your 2000 x 1000 image will become 1000 x 500.  
Your 500 x 1000 image will remain 500 x 1000.  
Your 1583 x 1583 image will become 1000 x 1000.  

Required Libraries 
------------------

It just requires Pillow. OS and Tkinter should already be installed in any Python installation. Commands below just in case!

pip install pillow
pip install tk
